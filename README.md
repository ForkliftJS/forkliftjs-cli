## Usage instructions
* Install ForkliftJS globally `npm install -g forkliftjs` (Will be split into a smaller cli package later)
* Install ForkliftJS locally into your project `npm install --save-dev forkliftjs` (It is recommended to pick a ForkliftJS Crate [A crate is a ForkliftJS starter project tailored for a specific environment/framework] instead)

## Usage tips
* Use NPM to install libraries over Bower for usage and performance benefits
* Install an ESLint plugin into your IDE of choice (it read the rules from .eslintrc)
* Install an EditorConfig plugin into your IDE of choice (it will make sure the IDE behaves in the same way for all project members)

  * vendor/ (contains vendor libraries that are not available on NPM nor Bower)
  * index.html (HTML entrypoint / Main template)
  * main.js (JavaScript entrypoint / Main module)
  * main.development.js (Development exclusive logic)
  * main.production.js (Production exclusive logic)
* tasks/ (contains the tooling's tasks i.e. serve, build)
* .babelrc (Babel settings)
* .bowerrc (Bower settings)
* .editorconfig (IDE settings)
* .eslintignore (ESLint ignored files)
* .eslintrc (ESLint linting rules)
* .gitattributes (Git settings)
* .gitignore (Git ignored files/folders)
* bower.json (Bower dependencies)
* karma.conf.js (Test runner settings)
* package.json (Project settings)
* run.js (Task runner script)
* spec.bundle.js (Webpack bundle for running tests)
* webpack.config.dev.js (Webpack development configuration)
* webpack.config.prod.js (Webpack production configuration)
* yuidoc.json (YUIDoc settings)
